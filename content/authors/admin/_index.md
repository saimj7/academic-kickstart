Hi! I'm an AI enthusiast with good knowledge in the areas of machine learning and experience in building AI for the perception of self-driving cars, with a focus on deep learning, computer vision and image processing! Since I was a kid, I love cars as much as I love my family! That's right, there's no trade-off. After a big deal of talking with myself, motivated to develop software for Autonomous and Electric vehicles. _(Note: Website is under electrification!)_


### Some facts:
- Music is how I medicate
- Iâ€™m a dj sometimes, to be vibrant
- Exploring and capturing the world
- They call me a striker in the game of cricket
- Respect for defense, excitement about jets, aerospace, railways
- Gamer 4 life and I can't live without a perfect Swedish Fika every day :)
