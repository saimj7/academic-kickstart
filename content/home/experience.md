  description = """Traffic Sign Recognition for Autonomous Driving. Skills: Python, TensorFlow-Keras, MATLAB.

  * Image pre-processing to attain the best classification accuracy for our Deep Learning model (Convolutional Neural Network).
  * Enhancing performance in Low light/noisy conditions by adding RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) connections like LSTM/GRU, CUDA accelerated layers.
  * Contribution to a more universal-regional dataset. The capability of GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) is investigated to generate new traffic signs on the sparsely available Indian traffic signs.

  We believe this approach is also fine tuned to be efficient in real-time driving for hardware implementations and computations, and we consider deploying it for several Deep Learning applications in future work!"""
